In practice, that means a hybrid will have a traditional internal-combustion engine and a fuel tank, as well as one or more electric motors and a battery pack. A petroleum-electric hybrid most commonly uses internal combustion engines (using a variety of fuels, generally gasoline or Diesel engines) and electric motors to power the vehicle. The energy is stored in the fuel of the internal combustion engine and an electric battery set.",

    "description": "Regular oil changes keep engines running smooth and help prevent issues down the road, and many drivers rely on oil changes with conventional motor oil to keep their vehicles in top shape. If you drive in more severe conditions — temperature extremes, lots of stop and go — manufacturers generally recommend that you replace your oil more often. ABM can advise you on the right oil change interval for your vehicle based on the way you drive. Oil change should be done every 3 months or 3000 km whichever comes first.",

    "description": "Like other vital automotive fluids, transmission fluid deteriorates over time. Hard use — such as frequent stop-and-go city driving will accelerate the deterioration. That kind of driving raises the operating temperature of the transmission, and heat puts more strain on the transmission and the fluid. Transmission fluid often is red but can come in other colors, and as it deteriorates it tends to turn darker. It may also acquire a burned odor that could indicate it needs to be changed or that the transmission is developing mechanical problems. Another indication it needs changing is dirt or other debris in the fluid. It is recommended that transmission fluid should be changed every 25,000 km or once a year in order to prolong the life of the transmission.",
